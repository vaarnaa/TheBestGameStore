Developers would be able to add their games to the webshop and set prices for them, and the players could buy them and play their purchaced games online.



### 3. Plans



#### 3.1. Page layout

* Horizontal navbar is displayed up top with links to home, available games, highscores and login/logout pages. Button for login/logout is aligned right and the others left.
* On the login page there will be login form for registered users, players and developers and possibility to login with gmail/facebook account. For new, unregistered users a link for registering is provided. If user successfully logs in, the user's purchased/developed games are shown below.
* On the higscores page a form for selecting games by developer and a search form by games name are shown and highscores about a particular game are shown below.
* On the available games page a form for selecting games by developer and a search form by games name are shown. The game(s) are shown below and after clicking the window, the user is forwarded to the game information page. On this page if the user is of type player and owns the game he/she can start playing it and otherwise is forwarded to the purchase page. On the game information page a developer can make modifications to the game (price, delete etc.)
